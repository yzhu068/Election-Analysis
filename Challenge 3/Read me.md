## Election-Audit Summary 
This Python Code Script allows you to analysis the total voting counts, track candidates name, tracking the votes of each candidates, and populate the percentage of votes for each candidates. It also can retrieve the candidate with the highest votes, which is the winner of the election. 

The same function applies to votes by counties. The code can track counties involves in this election, track total votes of each county, and populated the percentage of votes for each county. It will retrieve the county name with the highest votes. 

All results are exported to a txt. file, with all important imformation summarized. 

This code can be applied to different elections. It can be used for candidates of any number, and more counties/areas/citys/states can be involved. 

Now the code can only track candidates and counties names, however, it can be modifiled to track different areas of information, for example, if the csv. document also takes voters' age group, gender, occupations, and with modifications to the code, it will give us analysis for these information of interest.
